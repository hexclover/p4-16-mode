#+TITLE: P4_16 Mode for Emacs

=hexclover=: Since =package--description-file= only matches the =p4= part as
the package name in =p4-16-mode=, it looks wrongly for =p4-pkg.el=, which does
not exist. I simply rename and/or symlink as an ugly hack.

Below is the original description of the package on ELPA.
